# RedBlackTree_C
A simple but working Red Black Tree implementation.

@Before -> Nodes are printed on screen with black and red colors so use a terminal with white background (or whatever you like but not these 2 colors).

If you want to change colors further informations are avaible in ".h" file within print functions.

The program is very easy to use, just insert numbers. By the way text on console may guide you.

If you need a "delete node" function this link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redâ€“black_tree may help but must be revisited.
