# RedBlackTree_C
A simple but working Red Black Tree implementation.

@Before -> Nodes are printed on screen with black and red colors so use a terminal with white background (or whatever you like but not these 2 colors).

If you want to change colors further informations are avaible in ".h" file, within print functions.

Compile and run the program, then some informations on screen will help you.
